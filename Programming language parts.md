[[Programming languages]]

When learning new languages following questions can be useful:
- Syntax: How do you write the various parts of the language?
- Semantics: What do the various language feature means? For example how are expressions evaluated?
- Idioms: What are the common approaches to using the language feature to express computations? 
- Libraries: What has been already written for you? How do you do things you could not do without library support (like accessing files)?
- Tools: What is available for manipulating programs in the language (compilers, REPLs, debuggers)
