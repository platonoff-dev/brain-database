[[Software design]]

##Object-oriented programming

OOP is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.

Core principles:
**Encapsulation** - This principle states that all important information is contained inside an object and only select information is exposed. The implementation and state of each object are privately held inside a defined class

**Composition, inheritance and delegation** - New classes can be created based on another classes uses all or part of base class. 

**Polymorphism** - Property that allows to use base class as variable type and all child class objects. Then code doesn't rely on realization details.
