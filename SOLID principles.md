[[OOP]]

- S - [[Single responsibility principle]] There should never be more that one reason for a class to change
- O - [[Open-close principle]] Software entities should be open for extension, but close for modification
- L - [[Liskov substitution principle]] Functions that use pointers to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it. 
- I - [[Interface segregation principle]] Many client specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
- D - [[Dependencies inversion principle]] Depend upon abstractions not concretions
